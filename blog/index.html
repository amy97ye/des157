                  <p>In Chapter 12 of Steve Krug’s “Don’t Make Me Think”, the author explains why accessibility is important and how designers can start implementing different techniques to incorporate accessibility.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Accessibility in design is design that includes people with disabilities. For many designers and developers, inclusive and accessible design often takes the backseat to aesthetics. This may happen because many designers are not actively thinking about accessibility because they may not share the same problems as people who have trouble accessing websites. Designers also may not truly comprehend how many people have disabilities and how there is a real need for accessible design. It is important to incorporate accessibility in design because it’s the right thing to do. Designers can radically improve someone’s quality of life with their designs. So, in that sense, designers have a social responsibility of contributing positively to society. However, designers may be reluctant to make changes to their designs because they may need to compromise their aesthetic for functionality and it will be more work.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Although, incorporating accessibility may be hard, there’s a lot that designers can do right now to improve accessibility in web design. One of the easiest changes that could be made is always making sure there is alt text for every image and labels for every form input. This is important for people with screen readers so they can understand what is going on in the image without looking at it. It’s also important to use headings correctly and logically so that people scanning through sites can understand the content of the page. Keyboard accessibility is another way. Not everyone is able to use a mouse, so the most common way to scroll through content and pages are by pressing the tab button. In addition, designers can add a “skip to main content” link at the beginning of each page. The purpose of this is so that people with screen readers can skip listening to the navigation bar and go straight into the content. Visually, creating contrast between content and background can increase readability of the sight. For creators using sites like WordPress to create websites, there are many accessible templates that includes the design and functionality that people may need if they have a disability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Krug also recommended some reading for more in-depth knowledge on accessibility. Mary Theofanos and Janice Redish conducted a study called “Guidelines for Accessible and Usable Web Sites: Observing Users Who Work With Screen Readers”, which observed how people with screen readers interacted with websites. He also recommended two books: A <i>Web for Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences</i> by Sarah Horton and Whitney Quesenbery, and <i>Web Accessibility: Web Standards and Regulatory Compliance</i> by Jim Thatcher et al.

                  <p>I created a multi-tab to-do list. Although there is a simplistic and monochromatic design, it was the hardest studio so far. For this studio, I implemented session storage to locally save lists so that users can revisit it. Some cool features I included are:
                  </p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>
                              changing colors of the tabs on click
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              matching buttons throughout the design
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              adding tabs
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>
                    Even though all of these features don't work for all the tabs yet, the framework is there. They make the design is familiar and intuitive.

                <p>The concept for this design was to showcase the three most important parts of my day, which is dancing, studying, and sleeping. Some cool features that I implemented included:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            increasing the size of the image when hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            using setInterval to create animations on hover
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            changing the cursor on hover
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            adding three tool tips to help the user understand the interactive elements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            clicking images turns the captions on and off
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                  These solutions create a dynamic and fun interactive interface while maintaining a clean and minimalist design.

                <p>The concept for my design was inspired by YouTube videos showing what is in people's purses. The design is a purse that is pouring out its contents. The website's design is focused around the illustrations and their placement. Some interactive elements of my design included:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a halo effect when the pictures are hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a shaking animation when the pictures are hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the pictures fade in as the user scrolls down
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the cursor changes over interactive elements to show the user that they are interactive
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            clicking the interactive elements toggles the captions on and off
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                  These solutions worked because the user is able to focus in on what is being interacted with through the various animations. Thus, users can intuitively figure out what to do with the elements.

                <p>The web-based form that I use the most is the checkout form for online shopping. Most end up being straightforward, intuitive and easy to use. In addition, most browsers use auto-fill, which makes the checkout process even speedier. One
                    of my favorite stores to shop from is American Eagle. There is good use of hierarchy, through color and size. The heading for each section is a larger font that is dark blue. The empty form underneath is a light gray color. When a
                    certain input field is focused, the light gray border and font turns the same blue. When an input field is filled out, the text remains blue. This gives clear focus for the user. The interface communicates clearly, with minimal extraneous
                    elements. There is a unified design throughout and it matches what the user would expect from this form. Read more about learning IxD from everyday objects by clicking <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">here.</a></p>

                <p>The new year always comes with resolutions. One of mine this year was to start using a planning app. Although I’ve never been very good at keeping my resolutions, the Google Calendar mobile app is most effective one. Hopefully, it’s the
                    one that helps me keep my new year’s resolution. The layout is a single column that lists your schedule in a chronological order. There is a fixed button on the bottom right-hand corner that allows you to quickly add an event, a reminder
                    or a goal. The customizability along with fun colors and illustrations make app easy to use and easy on the eyes. It also makes it easy to group and sort different events into different calendars where you can toggle the view. The
                    best part about this app is the distinction between events and reminders. Reminders are perfect for staying on top of homework assignments while events help me remember my weekly meetings. Many calendar apps on the market don’t have
                    events and a dated to-do list. But Google Calendar does, which is why I love it so much. Overall, the functionality and design are streamlined, compact and easy to understand making it one of the best productivity apps out there.</p>
