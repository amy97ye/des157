                <h2>Studio 4</h2>

                <p>The concept for this design was to showcase the three most important parts of my day, which is dancing, studying, and sleeping. Some cool features that I implemented included:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            increasing the size of the image when hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            using setInterval to create animations on hover
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            changing the cursor on hover
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            adding three tool tips to help the user understand the interactive elements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            clicking images turns the captions on and off
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                  These solutions create a dynamic and fun interactive interface while maintaining a clean and minimalist design.

                <h2>Studio 3</h2>
                <h4>Final design and reflection | February 7th</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/studio3_1.jpg" alt="Studio 3 part 1" width="535">

                    <figcaption>Studio 3 animated design</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The concept for my design was inspired by YouTube videos showing what is in people's purses. The design is a purse that is pouring out its contents. The website's design is focused around the illustrations and their placement. Some interactive elements of my design included:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a halo effect when the pictures are hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            a shaking animation when the pictures are hovered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the pictures fade in as the user scrolls down
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the cursor changes over interactive elements to show the user that they are interactive
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            clicking the interactive elements toggles the captions on and off
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                  These solutions worked because the user is able to focus in on what is being interacted with through the various animations. Thus, users can intuitively figure out what to do with the elements.

                <h2>Online Shopping Checkout Form</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/form1.jpg" alt="shipping info" width="535">
                    <figcaption>Shipping information form</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The web-based form that I use the most is the checkout form for online shopping. Most end up being straightforward, intuitive and easy to use. In addition, most browsers use auto-fill, which makes the checkout process even speedier. One
                    of my favorite stores to shop from is American Eagle. There is good use of hierarchy, through color and size. The heading for each section is a larger font that is dark blue. The empty form underneath is a light gray color. When a
                    certain input field is focused, the light gray border and font turns the same blue. When an input field is filled out, the text remains blue. This gives clear focus for the user. The interface communicates clearly, with minimal extraneous
                    elements. There is a unified design throughout and it matches what the user would expect from this form. Read more about learning IxD from everyday objects by clicking <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Google Calendar</h2>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Google Calendar App on iOS</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The new year always comes with resolutions. One of mine this year was to start using a planning app. Although I’ve never been very good at keeping my resolutions, the Google Calendar mobile app is most effective one. Hopefully, it’s the
                    one that helps me keep my new year’s resolution. The layout is a single column that lists your schedule in a chronological order. There is a fixed button on the bottom right-hand corner that allows you to quickly add an event, a reminder
                    or a goal. The customizability along with fun colors and illustrations make app easy to use and easy on the eyes. It also makes it easy to group and sort different events into different calendars where you can toggle the view. The
                    best part about this app is the distinction between events and reminders. Reminders are perfect for staying on top of homework assignments while events help me remember my weekly meetings. Many calendar apps on the market don’t have
                    events and a dated to-do list. But Google Calendar does, which is why I love it so much. Overall, the functionality and design are streamlined, compact and easy to understand making it one of the best productivity apps out there.</p>
