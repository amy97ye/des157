        <p>The web-based form that I use the most is the checkout form for online shopping. Most end up being straightforward, intuitive and easy to use. In addition, most browsers use auto-fill, which makes the checkout process even speedier. One of my favorite stores to shop from is American Eagle. There is good use of hierarchy, through color and size. The heading for each section is a larger font that is dark blue. The empty form underneath is a light gray color. When a certain input field is focused, the light gray border and font turns the same blue. When an input field is filled out, the text remains blue. This gives clear focus for the user. The interface communicates clearly, with minimal extraneous elements. There is a unified design throughout and it matches what the user would expect from this form.

        <p>The new year always comes with resolutions. One of mine this year was to start using a planning app. Although I’ve never been very good at keeping my resolutions, the Google Calendar mobile app is most effective one. Hopefully, it’s the one that helps me keep my new year’s resolution. The layout is a single column that lists your schedule in a chronological order. There is a fixed button on the bottom right-hand corner that allows you to quickly add an event, a reminder or a goal. The customizability along with fun colors and illustrations make app easy to use and easy on the eyes. It also makes it easy to group and sort different events into different calendars where you can toggle the view. The best part about this app is the distinction between events and reminders. Reminders are perfect for staying on top of homework assignments while events help me remember my weekly meetings. Many calendar apps on the market don’t have events and a dated to-do list. But Google Calendar does, which is why I love it so much. Overall, the functionality and design are streamlined, compact and easy to understand making it one of the best productivity apps out there.</p>
