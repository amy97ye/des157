        <p>The new year always comes with resolutions. One of mine this year was to start using a planning app. Although I’ve never been very good at keeping my resolutions, the Google Calendar mobile app is most effective one. Hopefully, it’s the one that helps me keep my new year’s resolution. The layout is a single column that lists your schedule in a chronological order. There is a fixed button on the bottom right-hand corner that allows you to quickly add an event, a reminder or a goal. The customizability along with fun colors and illustrations make app easy to use and easy on the eyes. It also makes it easy to group and sort different events into different calendars where you can toggle the view. The best part about this app is the distinction between events and reminders. Reminders are perfect for staying on top of homework assignments while events help me remember my weekly meetings. Many calendar apps on the market don’t have events and a dated to-do list. But Google Calendar does, which is why I love it so much. Overall, the functionality and design are streamlined, compact and easy to understand making it one of the best productivity apps out there.</p>
