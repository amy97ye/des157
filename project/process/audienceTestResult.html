                      <p>For the functionality, the biggest issue that we were having was that after logging out, posts would not save. This is something that we are looking into with Firebase. However, we were able to get the authorization to work. So, it was really clear how to login, and the users thought the process was very easy.</p>

                      <p>
                        Other features that they suggested would be anonymous posting, implenting followers or friends, separating different sections of the posts, uploading pictures and adding the date of post. One tester suggested that we eliminate the home page because it was redundant.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Design-wise, the biggest suggestion was to add more graphical elements. Also, incorporating icons into the navigation would make it easier on the eyes. Some of the testers even suggested using the colors yellow and blue because they thought it worked with the kindness theme.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Overall, the experience was really pleasant! The testers all gave a lot of good advice and were all very nice as well. This was very helpful for me and Peiyi. Moving forward, we won't be able to implement everything they suggested but we will definitely be overhauling the design of the app by incorporating more graphic elements, date, location, anonymouse posting, and more.
