                <h2>User Goals</h2>
                <h4>February 28th</h4>
                <br />


                      <h4> How will your users understand the content of the project?</h4>
                      <p>There will be instructions at the beginning that will walk the user through the app and the goals of the app. The interface will be simple so it will be obvious what the content is and how they can contribute their own content to the website.</p>
                      <br />

                      <h4> How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h4>
                      <p>Users will understand the primary objective through an intuitive layout. It will be easy for users to find out how to post and search for other posts, as well as find friends and look at their posts.</p>
                      <br />

                      <h4> What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h4>
                      <p>Users would need social features like adding friends, filtering through posts by location and type.</p>
                      <br />

                      <h4> How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</h4>
                      <p>My project will be an social app and most of the audience will have a lot of experience with social media through apps like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
