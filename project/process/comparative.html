          PocketCause is an app that is marketed as much as a tool for nonprofits, as it is a tool for people to get involved and donate. This app makes it easy to donate money to different organizations that are partners with the app. PocketCause has done an amazing job making this app into a social media platform. It's easy for organizations to connect directly with their donaters and it's easy for people to share their posts. Another awesome feature is that the more social activity a user has, the user will collect points that can be donated to the nonprofits. One of the downsides of this app is that nonprofits must make an account with the app in order to be a part of it. Thus, many nonprofits may not know about the app or may choose not to be a part of it. Another downside is that their payment system is entirely their own system. For users, this means that they will have to sign up with another service to hold their sensitive information.

        <h4>One Today</h4>

          One Today is an app made by Google which is a minimalistic approach to donation and making change. The concept of this app is very simple: everyday the user will find a new nonprofit or cause to donate one dollar to. This allows the users to come back to the app time and time again because there will always be new content or a new place to donate to. A downside to this would be that since the organizations are curated, it may be hard to donate to causes that a specific person feels passionate about. However, one of the best things about the app is that the user interface is as simple, modern and sophisticated as the concept would imply, making it an easy app to navigate.
