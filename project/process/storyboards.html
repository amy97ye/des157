          One of the most helpful suggestions was to change the audience of the app. Instead of having people who did the nice things post their stories, people who received a nice gesture were the ones who shared their stories instead. That way, the app wouldn't be as narcissistic and self-serving. This way, the people who received kindness will be more inclined to be inspired to spread kindness as well. In addition, another suggestion was to make the app more general to by allowing people to just post inspiring stories. However, I do like the original and concept of the app. Making the app too broad may disinterest people because users wouldn't know what kind of stories they might could be reading. Other features that were suggested included adding filters by location and tags. These were all added into the revised story board.
