                        In the first prototype, I showed a basic login page, search page, browse page, and post page. I also added a side menu. Some of the features shown in the first prototype included location filters, searching by posts, users or tags, and a profile. One of the things I felt was missing was a home page with instructions. Some feedback suggested to add a text section in the post for users to describe how their story has inspired them to pass on the kindness. In addition, response was positive for the layout and the menu at the bottom.

                        In this prototype, I incorporated a home page with the three main functions of the app. Those three main functions match the menu at the bottom of the app. I also incorporated the feedback from the previous prototype about posting. In addition, I started to develop the profile aspect of the app as well.
